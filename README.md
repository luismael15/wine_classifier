# wine_classifier
Thanks to the dataset generated by P. Cortez of the University of Minho, we proposed a binary classification project between white and red wines.
Our intelligent algorithm will have to predict the wine class given a certain wine characteristics. 

In this project we will perform visualizations with seaborn and matplot lib. 
Additionally, we will apply an analysis of our dataset with pandas and a data preprocessing with sklearn. 
We will finish with the creation of two classifier models: KNeighborsClassifier and LogisticRegression. 
We will use the sklearn metrics to evaluate and compare our results.
